Project: Deploying a Node.js Express Website on AWS EC2 with Docker
Introduction
This project demonstrates the deployment of a Node.js Express website using Docker on an AWS EC2 instance. The goal is to understand the basics of cloud infrastructure, containerization, and web application deployment.

Features
Node.js Express Web Application: A demo website built with Node.js and Express.
Docker Containerization: The application is containerized using Docker for consistent and efficient deployment.
AWS EC2 Deployment: The Dockerized application is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance, allowing global accessibility.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

AWS Account: Set up and configure an AWS account.
Basic Knowledge of Docker: Understanding Docker basics, including containerization and Docker CLI.
Node.js and npm: Installed locally for running and managing the application.
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:


git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
Build the Docker Image:


docker build -t my-node-app .
Run the Docker Container Locally:


docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
Access the application at http://localhost:3000.

Create and Configure AWS EC2 Instance:

Launch an EC2 instance with the appropriate instance type and security groups.
SSH into the EC2 instance and install Docker.
Deploy the Docker Container on EC2:

Transfer the Docker image to the EC2 instance or build it directly on the instance.
Run the Docker container on the EC2 instance and configure security groups to allow access.
